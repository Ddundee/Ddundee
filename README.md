### About Me

I am a high schooler who is in love with programing (backend, and frontend seem awesome to me). I also enjoy remaking cool photos in vectors, and editing videos. I am currently relearning frontend, since my foundation was never great, so that I learn and develop a web based application using Native React, and other React based frameworks.
